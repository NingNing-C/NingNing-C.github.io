I'm a doctoral student at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/de.html) with a research focus on applying artificial intelligence to accelerate drug discovery, engineer therapeutic antibodies, and design experiments guided by machine learning.

I'm open to supervising semester projects and Master's theses involving hybrid experimental-computational work, combining high-throughput screening with uncertainty-aware machine learning. Contact me (ningning.chen@bsse.ethz.ch) to discuss! :D
